# hello-java-android

When starting a new project, I always find getting the tools up and running quickly is a pain, so I
wanted something for java / android which already had everything setup and working.

This is a WiP inspired by a similar repo for Kotlin / Android: https://github.com/compscidr/hello-kotlin-android

This aims to be a starter repo with all of the following tooling setup:
* [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) (unit + integration tests)

TODO:
* [Jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)
* [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-android)
* [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)
